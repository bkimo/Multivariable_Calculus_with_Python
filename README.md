# Multivariable_Calculus_with_Python
This learning module is to supplement the teaching of Multivariable Calculus.We rely on visuals to elucidate the core concepts, and on computational thinking for applying those concepts 
to useful settings. 


#### [T1_1](T1_1_Vectors.ipynb): Vectors
What is a vector? The physicist's view versus the computer scientist's view. Visualizing vectors. Fundamental vector operations: visualizing vector addition and multiplication by a scalar. 
Intuitive presentation of basis vectors, linear combination and span. 

#### [T1_2](T1_2_visualizing_space_curves.ipynb): Visualizing curves in space
